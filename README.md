# Todolist Android App

This is a really simple Android app that I will be building and writing about the Android learning process. It will help me to keep it up, learn some Android weird parts and share some knowledge with the community.

The basics concepts I will talk about here:
- Android Studio
- Activities and Fragments
- Adapters
- RecyclerView
- Toolbar
- Persistence with SQLite
- Material Design

My goal is to write this application and write a pratical and simple tutorial on my blog. You can check it out [here](http://www.bpaulino.com.br/)
